# About
You are Jekyll. An extremely unfortunate individual. You have awoken in a dark dungeon with no memory of how you got here. Strange bite marks are littered across your arms.  Your body keeps changing, right before your eyes, and you might be hearing strange voices in your head.
Achieve unity with your newfound "friends",  master your many forms, and escape the dungeon!
